987404;BLACKPINK;"BLACKPINK (stylized BLΛƆKPIИK) (블랙핑크) is a South Korean girl group under YG Entertainment. The members are JISOO, JENNIE, ROSÉ, and LISA. They have a versatile sound, ranging from YG’s signature hardcore hip-hop to slower songs bordering on A-town trap. According to a June 2016 Soompi article:

The meaning of Black Pink aims to contradict the common perception of the color pink. Pink is commonly used to portray prettiness, but Black Pink actually means to say that ‘Pretty isn’t everything.’ It also symbolizes that they are a team that encompasses not only beauty, but also great talent.

BLACKPINK officially debuted on August 8, 2016, releasing a two-track project titled Square One, featuring “BOOMBAYAH” and “Whistle.” The singles charted at #1 and #2 on Billboard’s World Digital Songs chart; and BLACKPINK are by far the fastest act to do so. On November 1, 2016, following the success of Square One, they released their second project, Square Two, which included “Playing with Fire” and “Stay.” On June 22, 2017, the group released their first standalone single, “AS IF IT’S YOUR LAST,” which debuted at #1 on Billboard’s World Digital Song Sales chart a day after its release. The music video amassed the most first-day views of any K-pop video at the time.

A year later, BLACKPINK returned with “DDU-DU DDU-DU,” the lead single of their four-track EP, SQUARE UP. The project performed well on the international charts and BLACKPINK broke another YouTube record with their music video for “DDU-DU DDU-DU”—becoming the most-viewed online video in the first 24 hours by a Korean artist. In October 2018, the group released a collaboration with British singer-songwriter Dua Lipa, titled “Kiss And Make Up.” A month later, BLACKPINK started their first world tour and held concerts in 18 countries across Asia, North America, Europe, and Oceania. In December, they debuted their first Japanese compilation album, Blackpink in Your Area containing every song they’d released at the time.

The following year, BLACKPINK released their second EP, Kill This Love. They also performed at the 2019 Coachella Festival on April 12 and April 19, becoming the first K-pop girl group to do so. On October 16, they put out the Japanese version of Kill This Love. In May 2020, BLACKPINK was featured on Lady Gaga’s “Sour Candy.” In the following months, the group released the singles “How You Like That” and “Ice Cream,” with Selena Gomez. Both are set to appear on BLACKPINK’s first full-length record. Following THE ALBUM, the girl group released a live album from their virtual concert THE SHOW and Japanese versions of the Korean songs in the record.

On July 22, 2022, BLACKPINK had an online concert collaboration with PUBG MOBILE called THE VIRTUAL, where you could listen to the first half of their song “Ready For Love,” which was originally teased in their documentary. A week later, the full version of “Ready For Love” was released exclusively on YouTube.

On August 19, 2022, BLACKPINK put out their pre-release single “Pink Venom,” which is part of their sophomore album BORN PINK. With the album’s tracklist release, “Ready For Love” is also included. The title track for this comeback is called “Shut Down.”";['BLΛƆKPIИK (블랙핑크)'];https://images.genius.com/d8c51d2049abbae996431c59caf0c524.1000x160x1.png;https://images.genius.com/f14a2a274e604fe899e667724a4875fc.1000x1000x1.png;{'facebook': 'BLACKPINKOFFICIAL', 'instagram': 'blackpinkofficial', 'twitter': 'BLACKPINK'};2836
70113;BTS;"BTS is a South Korean pop (hip-hop influenced) group consisting of RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook. The group’s name is an acronym for ‘Bangtan Sonyeondan’ (방탄소년단) which translates into ‘Bulletproof Boy Scouts.’

The group is currently one of the most recognized music acts worldwide, and holds over 20 Guinness World Records, and won over 350 main music awards.

The members are heavily involved in their music production, 90 percent of their lyrics are penned by them and some of them also act as producers.

BTS combines various genres of music, ranging from pop sounds like on “I Need U,” hip-hop (“욱 (UGH!)”) or  moombahton (“피 땀 눈물 (Blood Sweat & Tears)”), to British rock in “봄날 (Spring Day).” Lyrically, they lean heavily on the struggles and excitement of youth, but they also criticize social issues through songs like “뱁새 (Silver Spoon)” and “Am I Wrong,” causing them to be perceived as one of the more socially conscious k-pop artists.

The combination of their musical storytelling and aesthetic, powerful and heavily choreographed stage performances, and sneak peeks into their daily life through social media has earned them a loyal fanbase called ARMY.

The septet debuted on June 13, 2013, with “No More Dream,” of their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, which encourages their listeners to achieve their dreams. Throughout their various mini albums and a first studio album, Dark & Wild, BTS continued to display a rebellious concept with the addition of a newfound romance. The studio album also marked the end of the ‘school era.’

In 2015, they wholly evolved through ‘HYYH (The Most Beautiful Moment In Life) era,’ releasing three albums and defining themselves through referencing youth-related struggles and mental health in their lyrics.

In 2016 they released their second studio album, Wings. The album thematically deals with temptation and growth and is heavily inspired by Hermann Hesse’s novel, Demian.

In 2017 the group revealed a new brand identity—the new logo and they extended their name with ‘Beyond the Scene’ as the additional acronym for BTS. The group also began their ‘Love Yourself’ era and a year later released their third studio album, Love Yourself: Tear. Following this, BTS became the first-ever K-pop group to win the Billboard Music Award. They went on to win this award for the second time in 2018, overtaking other international superstars, and they debuted their song, “FAKE LOVE” on television at the BBMAs, another feat never seen before in the K-pop industry.

Also in 2017, as the first Korean artist, BTS joined the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to stage campaigns against violence toward children and teens around the world. One year later, BTS made history by being the first K-pop group to speak at the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and were awarded the fifth-class Hwagwan Order of Cultural Merit by the President of South Korea for the contribution to Korean culture.

In 2019 with a mini album they started the ‘Map of the Soul’ era. Following this, they were nominated for and earned two Billboard Music Awards—Top Social Artist and Top Duo/Group, becoming the first K-pop group to achieve the latter.

Their fourth studio album, Map of The Soul: 7, was released in 2020, and become #1 Album of 2020 Worldwide.

In September 2020, BTS became the first Korean act to hit #1 on Billboard Hot 100 with their first English language song as a lead artist, “Dynamite.” The song broke numerous worldwide records, including three Guinness World Records. The group held #1 simultaneously on seven Billboard charts. Just a few weeks later, BTS scored #1 on Billboard Hot 100 with the second song—“Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat) [BTS Remix].”

The fifth Korean studio album, BE, was released on November 20, 2020, with the lead single “Life Goes On.” The single debuted at # 1 on Billboard Hot 100, the first predominantly non-English-language song to do so. They later became the first Korean pop artist to be nominated for the GRAMMY Awards (for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance with “Dynamite”).

Following that, in May, the group released their second English language song as a lead artist, “Butter.” The song debuted simultaneously at #1 on four main Billboard US charts, and broke numerous records, including these set previously by “Dynamite.”

After seven weeks on #1 with “Butter,” BTS replaced themselves on top and debuted on it their next single, “Permission to Dance,” making them the first group in history to earn four #1 debuts on the Billboard Hot 100, and the first group in history to replace their #1 debut song with another #1 debut song.

In June 2022, the group released a three-disc collection, anthology album, PROOF, with the lead single, “Yet to Come (The Most Beautiful Moment).” The album compiles songs from BTS' discography that reflect the thoughts of the members on the past, present, and future of BTS.

Following that, BTS also announced their hiatus from group activities with plans to come back together in 2025. During this time they are completing their mandatory military service in South Korea, as well as exploring their solo projects and remaining active in other various activities.

In 2023, it was reported that all seven members renewed their exclusive contracts with BIGHIT MUSIC, where they will continue to work on future releases from 2025 onwards.

The band has eight members: Bang Chan, Lee Know, Changbin, Hyunjin, Han, Felix, Seungmin,  I.N. They can further be separated into three units: 3RACHA (the producing/rap unit), VOCALRACHA (the vocal unit), and DANCERACHA (the dance unit).

Stray Kids' first self-produced tracks were shown during the survival show, with first single “Hellevator” getting a music video prior to the show’s premiere. The rest of the tracks were included in their January 2018 pre-debut EP titled Mixtape which debuted at #2 on Gaon Album Chart and Billboard World Albums Chart.

Stray Kids officially debuted on March 25, 2018, with their lead single “District 9” and EP I am NOT. This was followed by two more EPs in 2018, I am WHO? and I am YOU. These three EPs make up Stray Kids' first trilogy, dubbed the I am… series. They were met with widespread success in 2018, with each EP outselling the last. Stray Kids picked up eight rookie awards in the 2018 award season.

The first installment of their second trilogy Clé was released on March 25, 2019, one year after their debut. Its' title track “MIROH” amassed a lot of public attention, earning the group their first music show win on MCountdown’s April 4 broadcast. The second installment’s title track, the psytrance “Side Effects” also gathered a lot of public attention due to its' originality. In October of that year, former member Woojin left the group, for what JYPE only revealed to be “personal reasons.” The final installment of the series, Clé : LEVANTER found Stray Kids starting to redefine their image as they dealt with the struggles of adapting to their new group line up.

The beginning of 2020 saw many projects for Stray Kids. Their first English versions were released on Step Out of Clé and Japanese versions on SKZ2020. The latter also included past songs with re-distributed parts to fit their new line up. Additionally, their Mixtape Project consisted of two unexpected releases: “Gone Days” and “On Track” and the band recorded the opening and ending songs for the anime Kami no Tō -Tower of God-.

Stray Kids' first full album, GO生 garnered a whole new image for the group. Released in June 2020, the title track “神메뉴 (God’s Menu)” showed off the group’s individuality and desire to do something different in the music industry, and it saw them a lot of success as the album topped the Gaon Chart. The effects of this inflation of success were evident in their next release, the repackage album IN生, with the album amassing  200,000 sales in the first week and title track “Back Door” garnering two music show wins. An official Japanese debut with “All In” followed shortly after.

2021’s activities started with Stray Kids joining MNET’s Kingdom: Legendary War, competing alongside other K-Pop boy groups and moreover, taking first place on the show overall. After the show, they continued their traditional ‘Mixtape Project’ with the digital single “애 (OH),” which topped the Billboard’s World Digital Song Sales, becoming the group’s first number one song on the chart and additionally, the release marked the return of member Hyunjin, who went on hiatus in February of the same year. To celebrate their unpredictable success, on July 21 the group announced the release of their second full-length album, NOEASY through its official, action-packed trailer. It has seen its daylight on August 23, along with the 3RACHA-composed title track, “Thunderous”, which gave them over six Korean music show wins, while the album itself helped Stray Kids become the first JYP Entertainment group to reach the million sales milestone. Following miscellaneous releases in the fall and early winter season, they closed the year with the second compilation album, SKZ2021.

From the beginning of 2022, Stray Kids started to receive massive recognition from the general public, both in South Korea and worldwide. They began the anticipation after the announcement of their sixth mini album, ODDINARY, supported by the title track “MANIAC” during their first offline fanmeeting, SKZ’s Chocolate Factory. After its initial release on March 18, the extended play became an instant success on the domestic and international charts and furthermore, it reached the top spot on the Billboard 200 chart.

Later on, the group embarked on their first ever arena tour, with the first three shows being held between April 29 and May 1 in Seoul’s Jamsil Arena, followed by another batch of concerts in Japan and North America in June and July. Soon afterwards, the group’s fourth Mixtape Project single, “Time Out” dropped on August 1 as a heartfelt gift to their fans, STAYs.

On the night of September 6, 2022, the release of Stray Kids' seventh mini album, MAXIDENT was confirmed. The project, featuring the wholesome title track “CASE 143” and three sub-unit songs, all premiered during their Unveil 11 concert, conveys the themes of love, relationships with others and oneself and true feelings. It also sold over 2 million copies on Hanteo in less than a week and topped the Billboard chart, making Stray Kids the only artist to debut two albums at number one on the list this year.

With their third full-length album, June 2023’s ★★★★★ (5-STAR), the group broke the record for the most pre-ordered album in K-pop history, recording a total of 4.93 million sales, while in November they came back with their eighth mini album, 樂-STAR. Its title track, “락 (樂) (LALALALA)” became Stray Kids' first ever song to enter the Billboard Hot 100 chart. By the end of the year IFPI named the boy group the third best selling artist of 2023, just behind SEVENTEEN and Taylor Swift.

In February 2024 the group collaborated with J.Y. Park and fellow labelmates ITZY and NMIXX on “Like Magic” to promote the so-called “K-Wave” edition of Coca Cola Zero, but the track was boycotted by the international fans due to the beverage company’s alleged ties with Israel. For the rest of the first quarter they’ve also held two fanmeetings to celebrate their seventh debut anniversary, made their debut at the prestigious Met Gala to represent themselves as the ambassadors of Tommy Hilfiger and released two promotional singles: “WHY?”, an OST for the J-drama Re: Revenge – Yokubo no Hate ni and “Lose My Breath”, a collaboration with Charlie Puth.

On July 18, 2024 it was confirmed that all eight members of Stray Kids have renewed their contracts with JYP Entertainment, while one day later they made a long-awaited comeback with their ninth mini album ATE, supported by the title track “Chk Chk Boom”. The project helped the group become the first one to top the Billboard 200 ranking with their first five charted albums and it was promoted through multiple appearances at music festivals worldwide (eg. BST Hyde Park) as well as the first arena-stadium tour, starting from August of the same year. Additionally, their Deadpool & Wolverine OST titled “Slash” seen its daylight just one week later after breaking another batch of records with ATE.

7811;Fall Out Boy;"Fall Out Boy is an American rock band hailing from Wilmette, Illinois. The band was formed in 2001 by Pete Wentz, who supplies bass and lyrics to the band, and guitarist Joe Trohman, who both used to be part of metalcore band Arma Angelus. Trohman later recruited vocalist Patrick Stump, who initially tried out as the band’s drummer, after meeting him in a bookstore. After the release of Project Rocket/Fall Out Boy, a split EP with Project Rocket. It was recorded without current drummer Andy Hurley due to him being disinterested in the project; Hurley later joined in 2003 as a replacement touring drummer.

Fueled By Ramen, who were a small independent label at the time, personally called Fall Out Boy to ask them to record a full-length record after hearing one of their demos online. This album became their 2003 debut, Take This To Your Grave, and was a tipping point between the band’s underground success to success in the mainstream. It was the band’s last album to feature Stump as the lead lyricist.

The band’s 2004 acoustic EP, My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue, became their first charting release and gave fans a taste of what to expect on their sophomore album From Under The Cork Tree. The album creation was set back in February 2005 after Wentz’s suicide attempt, which influenced songs such as “7 Minutes In Heaven (Atavan Halen).” The album was released in May 2005 through Island Records, featuring guest vocals from William Beckett of The Academy Is… and Brendon Urie of Panic! At The Disco.

2007’s Infinity On High saw the band subtly separate themselves from the pop-punk sound they were known for, featuring unexpected guests like rapper Jay-Z. The album was a huge mainstream success, being certified platinum in six countries and cementing Fall Out Boy as one of the biggest pop-punk bands of the time.

The band continued on their experimental tangent for their 2008 LP Folie à Deux, breaking away almost entirely from their pop-punk sound. The group had a lengthy promotion process, which included the release of mixtape CitizensFOB: Welcome To The New Administration. Lyrically focusing mainly on themes like decaying relationships and fame, the album received a mixed response from fans and critics.

In 2009, the band announced a hiatus to allow the members to focus on their own projects. Among other things, this break spawned Stump’s solo album Soul Punk, Wentz’s EDM project Black Cards, and Trohman and Hurley’s band The Damned Things.

2013’s Save Rock & Roll was recorded entirely in secret, and the group’s reformation only became apparent after the release of their lead single “My Song’s Know What You Did In The Dark (Light Em Up).” The record generally received positive reviews, and featured several all-star guests, including Elton John and Courtney Love. 2013 also saw the release of PAX AM Days, a punk-influenced EP that is described as the antithesis of Save Rock & Roll.

The 2015 release of American Beauty/American Psycho saw the band continue to push for a radio-friendly sound, while also experimenting with samples on many tracks. The single “Immortals”, appeared on the soundtrack of Disney’s Big Hero 6. The band later released Make America Psycho Again,, a rap remix album of American Beauty/American Psycho that disappointed both fans and critics.

The band’s seventh studio album, M A  N   I    A, was first teased in early 2017. It was initially slated for a September 2017 release, and early singles such as “Young and Menace” demonstrated an almost complete pull-away from their previous rock-influenced music for a more EDM inspired sound. The release date was subsequently pushed back to January after almost-completely scrapping of the material for the album. The album was shortly followed up with a limited demo EP titled LLAMANIA, which has been teased in the music video for “Wilson (Expensive Mistakes)”. The EP consisted of demo tracks that were scrapped from M A  N   I    A.

Before the band’s major project, “The MANIA Experience,” had taken into effect, Pete announced that a three-tracked EP would be released. This would include a studio version of the 2008 mixtape demo from “Welcome to the New Administration,” Lake Effect Kid, a semi-new song and a really new song. On August 22, a surprise proclamation had appeared in the band’s social media, stating that the Lake Effect Kid EP was going to be released at midnight. In its release, every song was heavily influenced by Chicago, the band’s hometown.";['Frosty and the Nightmare Making Machine'];https://images.genius.com/137599f0e17abe68d83057040170c06f.1000x525x1.jpg;https://images.genius.com/09a58549b054f8e444190958b795d15d.1000x1000x1.jpg;{'facebook': 'falloutboy', 'instagram': 'falloutboy', 'twitter': 'falloutboy'};3360
18261;My Chemical Romance;"My Chemical Romance is an alt/punk/hardcore rock band that produced four studio albums and a compilation album over their initial twelve-year lifespan from 2001-2013. They then went on a six-year hiatus, until Halloween of 2019, when they announced a long-awaited revival of the band. They have touched the hearts of millions through their honest, raw lyrics and inspirational stories.

The band started after front-man and founder Gerard Way witnessed the 9/11 terror attacks in New York City. He felt compelled to empower people and make a difference in the world. As a result, he wrote the band’s first song, “Skylines And Turnstiles.” He shared the lyrics with his friend Matt Pelissier, who agreed to be the then-unnamed band’s drummer. Gerard then recruited Ray Toro, whom he used to be in a band with as the lead guitarist, and eventually invited his brother Mikey Way to be the bassist, and Frank Iero to be the rhythm guitarist.

Their first album, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, was released in 2002. Some of the demos for the album were recorded in Matt Pelissier’s attic. Because of this, the demos are lovingly referred to as the “attic demos.” The album’s copyright warning reads:

Unauthorized duplication is a violation of applicable laws and will result in Gerard coming to your house and sucking your blood.

The band shot to stardom with their second album, Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge, which was released on Reprise Records. Songs like “I’m Not Okay,” “Helena,” and “The Ghost Of You” captivated listeners and expanded their fan-base. Following its release, the band played on the 2005 Vans Warped Tour, along with bands like Fall Out Boy and Avenged Sevenfold. Drummer Matt Pelissier decided to leave the band and was replaced by Bob Bryar.

The Black Parade, arguably the band’s most popular effort, was released in 2006, and was a concept album detailing the death of a character called The Patient. It was again released on Reprise Records, and was the last MCR album with Bob Bryar as drummer. Years after the album dropped, Gerard Way revealed that the band planned on calling it a day and splitting up:

When the tour basically ended with us conquering the world, we were supposed to ride off into the sunset. I can’t think of a better ending than that. [It didn’t end there] because you get into careers, mortgages, families, crews, people, the machine itself – not to mention expectations of a record label that invested quite a bit in you, that would like more out of you, a fanbase that wants more out of you.

Luckily for fans, TBP wasn’t the last of My Chem – they followed up the smash hit in 2010 with their final studio album, Danger Days. The album acted as a rebirth from the depressing concepts of their previous releases and involved more upbeat tracks and messages.

Following Danger Days, Conventional Weapons, a compilation album featuring ten previously unreleased songs, was gradually released: these tracks feature Bob Bryar, as they were recorded in 2009, prior to his departure from the band. The album was never released due to dissatisfaction from the band’s previous producer.

On March 22nd, 2013, the band announced that they were breaking up. A compilation album titled May Death Never Stop You was released, featuring a new song, “Fake Your Death.” Despite the upset fans' pleas, no definite answer has been given as to why they split. Some claim they had trouble with their record label, while others believe Gerard had relapsed into alcohol dependence. In the end, it was simply left at “personal reasons.”

The band took a six-year hiatus, assumed by most to be a permanent departure of the group. However, this wasn’t the case. On October 31, 2019, the band suddenly sprung their return to the music scene upon their fans, with a tweet advertising an upcoming reunion performance.  Tour dates followed soon after, but they were postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

132;USHER;"One of the most successful contemporary R&B artists of all time, Usher is a Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, dancer and actor. He has sold over 80 million records worldwide, released several #1 singles and multi-platinum albums–including one diamond album–in his decades-long career.

Born Usher Terry Raymond IV in Dallas, Texas on October 14, 1978, he was raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he began singing in the church choir when he was nine years old before he and his “momager” Jonetta Patton moved down to Atlanta, Georgia. At ten years old, Usher joined the group Nu Beginning but eventually left after recording a few songs. At 13 years old, he appeared on the talent show Star Search and in 1993, L.A. Reid signed him to LaFace Records with Usher’s debut single “Call Me a Mack” being released the same year on the Poetic Justice soundtrack. L.A. Reid sent Usher to New York to live and work with up-and-coming producer Sean “Puff Daddy” Combs, who helped produce Usher’s debut album.

In the summer of 1994, 15-year-old Usher released his self-titled debut album but it didn’t make much noise. His 1997 sophomore album My Way put him on the map as he connected with Atlanta producer Jermaine Dupri, who produced seven of the album’s 10 songs, including the platinum singles “You Make Me Wanna,” “My Way” and “Nice & Slow,” which became Usher’s first #1 pop hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. His third album, 8701, was released in 2001 and was another multi-platinum success as the album’s first two singles, “U Remind Me” and “U Got It Bad,” both topped the pop charts, while “U Don’t Have to Call” peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Usher reached superstar status in 2004 with the release of his fourth album Confessions, which sold 1.1 million copies in its first week. The singles “Yeah!,” “Burn,” “Confessions Part II” and “My Boo” all reached the top of the pop charts, which helped the album sell over 20 million copies worldwide and reach diamond status in the US with more than 10 million sales. He followed that success with two platinum albums, 2008’s Here I Stand, which features the #1 single “Love in This Club,” and 2010’s Raymond v. Raymond, which features the #1 pop hit “OMG” and the #1 R&B hit “There Goes My Baby.” He released more singles such as his #1 R&B quadruple platinum non-album track “I Don’t Mind” with Juicy J and albums such as his 2018 collaborative album A with producer Zaytoven. He has also collaborated with many artists such as Lil Jon, Ludacris, Rick Ross, Chris Brown, J Balvin, Jung Kook (정국) and Justin Bieber, who Usher and Scooter Braun signed to their Raymond Braun Media Group in 2007.

Usher has appeared in several movies such as The Faculty, She’s All That, and Light It Up, and he also appeared in TV shows such as Moesha, where he played a love interest of fellow R&B singer Brandy. He also appeared as a judge on the NBC singing competition The Voice for three seasons. He has won numerous awards and was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on September 7, 2016. He also became a minority owner of the NBA’s Cleveland Cavaliers in 2005 and celebrated the team’s first championship in June 2016.

In 2020, Usher began residency performances in Las Vegas, starting at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace before he moved to Dolby Live at Park MGM in 2022. In 2023, Usher received an honorary doctorate degree from the Berklee College of Music, and in 2024, he was announced as the headliner for the Super Bowl LVIII Halftime Show in Las Vegas with his performance coinciding with the release of his ninth album, Coming Home.";"['U.

621678;Cardi B;"Born on October 11, 1992, and raised in The Bronx, New York, Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar—under the stage name Cardi B—is a American rapper and TV personality known for her friendly attitude. From 2015 to 2017 she starred on the TV show Love & Hip Hop, on which she landed a role after she became popular on the internet due to her personality and stripping endeavors. Following her departure from the series, she attained success in music with her chart-topping summer smash “Bodak Yellow.” She is married to Migos member Offset. Cardi also gave birth to Kulture Kiari Cephus, Offset’s fourth child and Cardi’s first.

Cardi began her music career in 2015 and released two installments of her Gangsta Bitch Music mixtapes series up until January 2017. The tapes went by relatively quietly but caught the attention of Atlantic Records, where Cardi inked a deal in February of 2017. Shortly after, Cardi proved her worth when she entered the mainstream music scene with the release of her smash single “Bodak Yellow” on June 16, 2017. The single obtained the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100, which marked the first time a female rapper achieved this since Lauryn Hill did the same with “Doo Wop (That Thing)” in 1999. “Bodak Yellow” was certified 5x Multi-Platinum by the RIAA on February 28, 2018, for selling 5 million units in the US.

Speculations of a relationship between Cardi B and Offset arose in early 2017 after the two were repeatedly sighted together. On October 29, 2017, Offset proposed to Cardi on stage at a Philadelphia show. They have collaborated on what was at one point Cardi’s most popular single, “Lick,” Migos' “MotorSport,” “Um Yea,” and “Drip.”

Following her engagement and the success of “Bodak Yellow,” Cardi released the follow-up single “Bartier Cardi” featuring 21 Savage just in time for Christmas. Cardi followed that up with features on the Multi-Platinum singles “No Limit” with G-Eazy and A$AP Rocky, and “Finesse (Remix)” with Bruno Mars. Cardi released her debut album, Invasion of Privacy, on April 6, 2018.

On January 2nd, 2018, Cardi B became the third artist (and first rapper) to have her first three Billboard Hot 100 entries (“Bodak Yellow,” “No Limit,” and “MotorSport”) in the chart’s top 10 simultaneously, joining only The Beatles and Ashanti in achieving the feat.

She also became the first female rapper in history to achieve four #1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100.";['Belcalis Almánzar' 'Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar' 'Bacardi' 'Bardi'];https://images.genius.com/504f792fd4d6e6b8e65017f8c7c5ba9e.1000x104x1.png;https://images.genius.com/d5bbcaf7670898ab17561293397ec48f.572x572x1.png;{'facebook': 'IamCardiB', 'instagram': 'iamcardib', 'twitter': 'iamcardib'};2818
12418;Ed Sheeran;"Ed Sheeran is a British singer and songwriter who was born in Halifax, England but was raised in Suffolk, England. He’s known for his energetic live shows, which involve him using a loop pedal and sometimes throwing some raps in for good measure.

Ed’s success story began with him playing music in older people’s homes. He first was picked up by a record producer when busking in the USA. He performed nearly a thousand gigs and street performances before getting the recognition he deserved. Unsigned projects such as Loose Change and Songs I Wrote with Amy relied on the production of long-term collaborator Jake Gosling and signaled the start of their hugely successful musical relationship.

The song now has over a million sales in the UK and two million in the US.

Picked up by Asylum/Atlantic Records, Sheeran released another single entitled “You Need Me, I Don’t Need You.” He released his debut album + in September 2011, to great critical acclaim. It topped the UK Albums Chart and has sold nearly two million copies in the UK alone.

Many successful singles, features, and an EP with Yelawolf later, Ed scored his first UK #1 with the Pharrell Williams-produced “Sing”. Then came his 7x Platinum sophomore album x, which features a slew of hugely successful singles including “Don’t”, “Thinking Out Loud” and “Bloodstream”.

1238161;Forest Blakk;"The music of Forest Blakk comes from an unshakable sense of purpose, a belief in building beauty from life’s most painful moments. Growing up in Montreal, Canada, with time spent in Florida and Jamaica, the singer/songwriter first took up guitar as a refuge from his chaotic home life. He then spent years learning to channel his most complex emotions into song. Over time, that devotion has forged a deep-rooted connection with his fanbase—a particularly meaningful triumph for the L.A.- based musician, who once held an impromptu concert at the back of a diner for a pair of fans who’d missed that night’s show. With the arrival of his breakthrough single “If You Love Her”—a fall 2020 release that marks his Billboard debut—Blakk has brought his heart-on-sleeve songwriting to a whole new level of resonance, again proving music’s power to transform both audience and artist.

“It’s been a massive metamorphosis for me to understand that you really can sing your way out of hell,” Blakk says. “I make this joke all the time: ‘I couldn’t sing to save my life, so I learned to sing to save my life.’ And that’s what this all feels like.”

Like many of Blakk’s songs, “If You Love Her” came to life during a time of intense heartache. “That song was inspired by me getting my heart broken but wanting to honor the relationship and honor that partner,” he explains. “It’s a way of saying: ‘We may not be meant for each other, but I genuinely hope that everything works out for you, and that the next person who comes along gets it right.’” Co-written and co-produced with Steve Solomon (James Arthur, Aloe Blacc), the starkly arranged and deceptively simple track unfolds with an emotional intensity that Blakk attributes to the spontaneous nature of the creative process. “We were in the studio, I grabbed a guitar, and the song just poured out,” he recalls. “It was completely raw, to the point where I’m all but crying into the mic. By the time we were done, I felt like I’d really served the message in my heart, and captured that feeling in the most pure and honest way I possibly could.”

With its intricate detail and lucid self-expression, “If You Love Her” reveals the lyrical finesse that Blakk first cultivated by writing poetry as a kid. At age 15, he began exploring his musical side by learning to play a guitar given to him by his grandmother. By that point, Blakk had endured an entire lifetime’s worth of trouble: born in Montreal, he spent much of his childhood with his mother (who struggled with addiction) and his stepfather (a notorious drug dealer), moving around constantly and eventually finding himself on and off the streets after his stepdad went to prison. But within two years of picking up the guitar, Blakk had joined a rock band and started to create songs of his own, drawing endless inspiration from one of his all-time favorite tracks: “Desperado” by the Eagles, which he still holds as a touchstone when it comes to crafting lyrics. “Don Henley’s mastery of words on that song has always stuck with me—I’ve never been able to escape it,” he notes.

Soon after moving to Calgary at age 21, he formed a band that later earned a JUNO nomination and played for crowds of thousands a night. In the years following the band’s dissolution, Blakk experienced a period of great transformation, ultimately embracing the more soulful and folk-infused sound that defines his music today. One of the first songs embodying that sound, a deeply vulnerable track called “Love Me” promptly earned attention from heavyweights like Pete Ganbarg (president of A&R at Atlantic Records) and legendary music exec Seymour Stein, paving the way for Blakk signing to Atlantic in 2015.

 Through the years, Blakk has shown extraordinary dedication to his ever-expanding following. “I remember being homeless as a teenager and feeling like I was invisible,” he says. “So the more things that happen for me now and the more visible I become, the more I want to shine that light back on other people. If I can give someone even just a few minutes of my time, there’s no telling what kind of impact it could have.” To that end, Blakk has included his personal phone number when self-releasing spoken-word pieces like 2018’s “Swipe Right,” and, over the past several years, has made a tradition of making phone calls to fans. And with the breakout success of “If You Love Her,” he’s seen an unprecedented number of listeners reach out to share their reactions to the song. “I’ve had people tell me things like, ‘My parent passed away and I feel like they’re speaking to me through your lyrics,’ or ‘I want this song at my wedding,’” says Blakk. “I wrote it from one angle and now it’s being interpreted in so many different ways. That’s so crazy and beautiful to me.”

Referring to his bond with his fans as a “symbiotic relationship,” Blakk is quick to point out how profoundly those interactions have affected him. “For a long time, I didn’t know what my value was. I thought I’d end up a gangster because that’s what I was born into,” he says. “I started making music because it made me feel good, and once I heard from other people that it made them feel good too, I felt like my life had some kind of meaning. I hope that helps people see that not all stories are born in beautiful castles—sometimes they’re born in absolute emptiness, but there’s always the chance to grow from that. You can really build a whole kingdom on top of the pain.”";[];https://images.genius.com/d7c4ca6cd106c22f19064180ee92104f.500x500x1.jpg;https://images.genius.com/daaf86f65aa96ff7dda0a3aa54f7d53d.1000x1000x1.jpg;{'facebook': 'Forest Blakk', 'instagram': 'ForestBlakk', 'twitter': 'ForestBlakk'};22
1256;Ice-T;"Ice-T is a rapper and actor raised in South Los Angeles who was one of the most important figures in gangsta rap in the ‘80s and early ‘90s. In 1986, he crafted one of gangsta rap’s defining songs, “6 in the Mornin'.” He continued to be a pioneer for the genre when his 1987 debut album, Rhyme Pays, became the first hip-hop album to feature an explicit content sticker. In the early ‘90s he formed the heavy metal band Body Count and caused a national controversy with their 1992 single “Cop Killer”—which was accused of promoting violence against police. The song earned the ire of then-President George H.W. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle but also won supporters who defended the song on First Amendment grounds.

Born Tracy Lauren Marrow, Ice-T hails from New Jersey. Both of his parents died from heart attacks, his mother passed when he was 8 and his father passed four years later. Following their deaths, he moved to View Park-Windsor Hills in South Los Angeles to live with an aunt. He began reading books by Iceberg Slim, which is how he earned his moniker—a tribute to the author. He would later join the Army, began pimping, and claims he became a bank robber for a brief period before focusing on music.

Marrow started out as a DJ but soon started rapping instead. In the early ‘80s, he released a series of electro hip-hop songs that were popular in clubs—but only after hearing Schoolly D’s “P.S.K. What Does It Mean?” did he find his niche. Inspired by Schoolly D’s gangsta raps, Marrow was inspired to create his own. With “6 in the Mornin'” he became the first rapper to explicitly rap about Los Angeles gang life. The song helped Marrow sign a deal with Sire Records, who released his debut album, 1987’s Rhyme Pays. His 1988 follow-up, Power, found him continuing to refine his style. Power was also notable for two things: 1) It featured Ice dissing LL Cool J and 2) It’s classic cover became a source of controversy thanks to Darlene Ortiz, Ice-T’s girlfriend at the time, who was scantily clad and holding a shotgun on the cover.

In 1991, Ice-T released what’s arguably his best album, O.G. Original Gangster. He also introduced his heavy metal band, Body Count, on the album.";['Tracy Marrow' 'Tracy Lauren Marrow'];https://images.genius.com/5af2e40e8125055a930420a4af650183.700x393x1.jpg;https://images.genius.com/86b9e63b9a38d5cc3e34cf27569b4d81.300x300x1.jpg;{'facebook': '', 'instagram': 'icet', 'twitter': 'FINALLEVEL'};161

130;Drake;"Aubrey Drake Graham (born October 24, 1986), professionally known by his middle name Drake, is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and entrepreneur.

Drake is part of a generation of rappers, along with Wiz Khalifa, Kid Cudi, and others, who came up through internet mixtapes. Drizzy put out three mixtapes from 2006 to 2009: Room for Improvement, Comeback Season, and So Far Gone. These mixtapes got him the attention of Lil Wayne, and spawned the hit singles “Forever” and “Best I Ever Had,” the latter coming from his critically acclaimed mixtape So Far Gone. During this period, Drake also made a slew of guest appearances on tracks by artists from DJ Khaled to JAY-Z.

Even before the release of his debut album, Drake was being referred to by Billboard as “the biggest buzz” and “possibly the most sought-after artist” in hip-hop. Reportedly three major labels were courting him in “one of the biggest bidding wars ever.” Even a New York Times article began, “If there was a time in hip-hop before Drake, it’s tough to remember.” Drake finally signed to Lil Wayne’s Young Money Entertainment label in 2009 and his debut album Thank Me Later came out the following year. His second album, Take Care, was released in November 2011 and ultimately led to celebration with his crew for earning his first Grammy Award (for Best Rap Album). The album has been certified diamond as of October 24, 2025, becoming the first rap album released in the 2010s to sell ten million units. His third studio album, Nothing Was The Same, was released September 24th, 2013. Two years later on February 13, 2015, Drake released If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late. Just months after that, he released a collaborative mixtape with American rapper Future, called What A Time To Be Alive. His fourth studio album, Views, was released on April 29, 2016. Following the release of Views, Drake announced the release of his new “playlist,” More Life, on OVOSOUND Radio. It was released on March 18, 2017.

On January 19, 2018, Drake surprisingly released a two-track EP, which was titled Scary Hours. In the following weeks Drake would make a song with his friend BlocBoy JB called “Look Alive”, the song would debut at #6 on the billboard and would mark Drake’s 23rd Top 10 Billboard hit. After “God’s Plan” debuted and spent 11 consecutive weeks at #1 on Billboard, Drake released “Nice For What” to continue the streak of a successful 2018. “Nice for What” would go on to replace “God’s Plan” as the #1 song on the Hot 100. Drake went on to release his fifth studio album Scorpion on June 29, 2018. It featured 25 tracks and was released as a double album. Upon release, it set the single-day album streaming record on both Apple Music and Spotify and broke the first-week streaming record for an album in a mere three days. That week, a record-shattering seven songs from the album placed in the Billboard Hot 100’s top ten.

In a December 25, 2019 interview with Rap Radar, Drake confirmed upcoming music. He followed this statement up by releasing two songs with Future, “Life is Good” and “Desires,” on January 10, 2020, and January 31, 2020, respectively. A month later, Drake would drop two tracks: “When to Say When” and “Chicago Freestyle.” On April 3, 2020, Drake released “Toosie Slide,” the first official single from his upcoming material. Dark Lane Demo Tapes, Drake’s 5th official mixtape, was released on May 1, 2020, with the promise of a new studio album for summer 2020.

On October 24, 2020, Drake’s 34th birthday, he revealed the album trailer for Certified Lover Boy and announced a January 2021 release date, which was postponed following a knee injury. On March 4th, 2021, Drake released Scary Hours 2, the sequel to Drake’s January 2018 EP Scary Hours. The mixtape includes features from Lil Baby and Rick Ross. Certified Lover Boy finally dropped on September 3, 2021.

Drizzy has also been involved in many beefs, including ones with Common,  Tyga, Kendrick Lamar, and Pusha T. His most eventful beef was with Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill. This started the whole conspiracy over “Drake has a ghostwriter.” Drake fired back immediately with “Charged Up” and with no response from Meek, he dropped another diss track four days later titled “Back to Back.” Meek then released his diss track titled “Wanna Know.”.

89;Rihanna;"A true pop icon, Robyn “Rihanna” Fenty is a singer, actress, and businesswoman from Saint Michael, Barbados. She was first discovered by American record producer Evan Rogers in 2003 and later signed a contract to Def Jam Recordings in 2004, after auditioning for its then-president, JAY-Z.

The following year, in 2005, she released her debut album Music of the Sun and its follow-up, A Girl Like Me, in 2006. Both albums did well commercially, but it wasn’t until the release of her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad, in 2007 that poised Rihanna as an international pop star. It became her first album to receive a Grammy nomination (seven to be exact) and features one of her biggest hits, “Umbrella.”

Moving onto 2009, Rihanna released her fourth studio album, Rated R. It featured a darker and more atmospheric tone from her previous albums. She released her fifth studio album, Loud, the next year in 2010. It marked her return to making dance-pop records. That summer, she featured on Eminem’s smash hit, “Love the Way You Lie” and is one of her most popular features of all time.

Rihanna continued her album streak in 2011 when she released her sixth studio album, Talk That Talk. It’s lead-single, “We Found Love,” became her biggest hit to date, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for ten weeks. The next year, in 2012, she released her seventh studio album, Unapologetic.

2013 ended Rihanna’s three-year album streak, taking a short break from recording music. Instead, she featured on songs like Wale’s “Bad (Remix)” and Eminem’s “The Monster.” The following year, in 2014, Rihanna left Def Jam Recordings to sign fully with JAY-Z’s Roc Nation.

2015 saw Rihanna’s return to making solo music, releasing singles like “FourFiveSeconds,” “Bitch Better Have My Money” and “American Oxygen.” The following year, in 2016, she released her eighth studio album ANTI.

In 2017, Rihanna featured on a few hit songs like Kendrick Lamar’s “LOYALTY.” and DJ Khaled’s “Wild Thoughts.” That same year, she announced she began working on her ninth studio album, although a proper release date has yet to be announced.

With all her hard work, Rihanna has become one of the most awarded artists in history, winning 214 in total. Of these awards include nine Grammy Awards, twelve Billboard Music Awards, thirteen American Music Awards, and seven MTV Video Music Awards.

Aside from music, Rihanna has ventured into other affairs like acting, starring in big movies like Ocean’s 8, This Is the End, Battleship, and the animated cartoon, Home. Rih also launched the highly successful cosmetics brand, Fenty Beauty, in 2017 and was also appointed as an Ambassador of Barbados in 2018.";"['Robyn Fenty' 'Robyn Rihanna Fenty' 'R.

615550;Billie Eilish;"Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell (born December 18, 2001), known professionally as Billie Eilish, is an American singer and songwriter born and raised in Los Angeles, California.

Working alongside her older brother Finneas O'Connell (Stylized as FINNEAS), her co-writer and producer, she’s taken the internet by storm with her haunting vocals and eerily beautiful lyrics and genre-defying production that was poised to breakout.

For Eilish, creating music wasn’t always her niche—dancing was. Born and raised in the entertainment mecca of Los Angeles, Eilish comes from a family comprised of musicians and actors, but was enthralled in the spotlight of dance. However, amid a growth plate injury in 2015, she became an underground pop sensation.

Singing and songwriting had never been unknown to Eilish, having written her first song at four and joined the Los Angeles Children’s Choir at eight. So, when her dance instructor was looking for a song to choreograph, Eilish, with help from O'Connell, created “ocean eyes.” The two also agreed to upload it to SoundCloud, where it went viral with over two million streams, landing her a record deal with Interscope.

From there, several remixes spawned and a follow-up single, “Six Feet Under,” was released the following year.

In 2017, she released her debut extended-play (EP), dont smile at me, which received mainstream applause and landed her a spot on Apple Music’s showcase for upcoming artists, UpNext. The EP also hit the top 40 on the Billboard 200 on July 19th. As of 2024, its overall peak on the chart is #14.

On March 29th, 2019, Eilish released her highly anticipated debut album, WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? — a record centered around Eilish’s fascination with dreams, nightmares, and fears. Two weeks before its release, the album was officially given the title of “most pre-saved album of all time on Apple Music,” with over 800,000 to its name. The album peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200 upon release, and was reigning for three weeks.

In 2020, Eilish was nominated in six categories for the 62nd Grammy Awards ceremony, alongside O'Connell. She was nominated in the five main categories, Album of the Year, Best New Artist, Best Pop Solo Performance, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year. The sixth category was Best Pop Vocal Album. Eilish would go on to win five of the six Grammys in the ceremony: Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO ?, Song and Record of the Year for “bad guy,” and Best New Artist. Eilish had made history that night by becoming the youngest and second artist to win in all four general field categories in one night.

Eilish then went on to create “No Time To Die” for the James Bond film of the same name, which made her the youngest person to write and record a James Bond theme song to date.

In early 2021, Eilish and O'Connell won at the 63rd Grammy Awards in two categories: Best Song Written for Visual Media for “No Time To Die” and Record of the Year for “everything i wanted,” which was Eilish’s first release after her debut album.

On April 26th, 2021, Eilish teased her sophomore album’s title track, “Happier Than Ever.” Shortly after, billboards began to appear in different locations, which revealed the album’s title and release date of July 30th, 2021. An Instagram post from April 27th revealed the album’s cover artwork and announced the release of a new single on April 29th of that year. Eilish broke her previous record for the most pre-saved album with a whopping 1,028,000 pre-saves for Happier Than Ever. The album peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200 upon release.

On March 22nd, 2022, Eilish and O'Connell won their first Academy Award for Best Original Song for “No Time To Die.” The Award was both the first nomination and the first win for the duo, and was also record-breaking, with Eilish becoming the youngest artist to have three awards on the same song.

In July of 2022, Eilish released the EP Guitar Songs, which consisted of two songs, “TV” and “The 30th.” “TV” peaked at #52 on the Billboard Hot 100, while “The 30th” peaked at #79.

One year after the release of the EP, Eilish released the highly-anticipated “What Was I Made For?” for the Barbie (2023) soundtrack. The track peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100. Additionally, the track was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song and three Grammys for Song of the Year, Best Song Written for Visual Media, and Best Music Video for the 66th Grammy Awards.

At the 66th Grammy Awards in 2024, “What Was I Made For?” won Eilish and O'Connell Song of the Year and Best Song Written for Visual Media. Later, at the 96th Academy Awards, the duo won their second Award for Best Original Song for “What Was I Made For?,” which garnered Eilish the youngest double Oscar winner.

Eilish then began teasing her third studio album, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT, in April of 2024 by using billboards to share song lyrics from the album’s tracks. The album’s tracklist was posted without permission by Rolling Stone, but was quickly taken down. Eilish then announced the tracklist on Instagram ten days later. Additionally, the album’s title – among other things – was teased on Eilish’s Close Friends story on Instagram, when she displayed a hip tattoo of part of the title. Prior to the release date of May 17th, Eilish began teasing the tracks “LUNCH,” “CHIHIRO,” “BIRDS OF A FEATHER,” and “L'AMOUR DE MA VIE” at different places that included Coachella.

On May 17th, 2024, Eilish released her third studio album, which peaked at #2 on the Billboard 200, and became her first album not to peak at #1 upon release. The album was released alongside “LUNCH,” which acted as the lead single. During the release week, Eilish had put out isolated vocals, sped up, and slowed and reverbed versions of the album.

During the early days of August, Eilish collaborated with Charli XCX (Stylized as Charli xcx) for “Guess,” a track from her 2024 album Brat. The collaboration was teased by Eilish during an interview with Apple Music.";"[""Billie Eilish O'Connell"" ""Billie O'Connell""

628;Pitbull;"Pitbull (born January 15, 1981) is a Cuban-American rapper and MC, born and raised in Miami, Florida. Nowadays, he’s left his MC abilities and centered his career on the pop and mainstream industries.

In 2001, Pitbull, also known to fans as Mr. 305 and Mr. Worldwide, signed with Uncle Luke’s Records. There, he started his career as an MC, throwing out a trilogy of mixtapes under the name Unleashed. Through Uncle Luke, he came to know other people in the movement such as Lil Jon and the Diaz Brothers.

In 2004, he released his debut LP, M.I.A.M.I. with the lead single “Culo,” produced by Lil Jon and the Diaz Brothers. It arguably would become a club banger. However, Jamaican artist Mr. Vegas accused Pitbull of copying his 2004 track titled “Pull Up.” This would lead to a beef, to which Pîtbull responds with “Mr. Vegas Diss.”

As Pitbull’s discography progressed, he would later shift to pop/electronic music and adopt the Mr. Worldwide moniker. Hits after this transformation would include “Give Me Everything”, “International Love”, “Feel This Moment”, “Timber”, “Fireball”, and “Time Of Our Lives”.";"['Mr. Worldwide' 'Armando Perez' 'Armando C.
